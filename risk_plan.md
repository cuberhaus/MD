# Risk: Data security breach
## Prevention:

Ensure all team members have proper security clearance and access levels to sensitive data.
Use encryption technology and secure file sharing platforms through Github with SSH protocols.
## Management:

Immediately notify the data owner and project sponsor of any breach.
Follow the organization's incident response plan.
Identify the cause of the breach and take steps to prevent it from happening again.
Work with IT and security teams to address any vulnerabilities and implement additional security measures.
# Risk: Unavailability of key team members
## Prevention:

Have a clear project timeline and assign clear roles and responsibilities to each team member.
Identify backup team members who can fill in if someone is unavailable.
Hold regular team meetings and communicate frequently to ensure everyone is aware of their responsibilities and progress.
## Management:

If a team member becomes unavailable, immediately identify a backup team member to take their place.
Reallocate responsibilities as necessary to ensure the project stays on track.
Communicate any changes to the project sponsor and stakeholders.
# Risk: Inaccurate or incomplete data
## Prevention:

Establish a clear data quality control process, including data cleaning and validation.
Use multiple data sources to verify accuracy and completeness.
Have a clear understanding of the data source and any limitations or biases.
## Management:

Address any errors or omissions in the data as soon as they are discovered.
Work with the data owner to identify the cause of the issue and take steps to prevent it from happening again.

Any changes to the project scope must be reviewed and approved by the project sponsor.
If a change is approved, update the project plan and communicate the changes to the team.
Manage resources and timelines to ensure any scope changes do not impact the overall project delivery.

# Risk: Technical failure
## Prevention:

Use reliable hardware and software.
Have a backup plan for data storage and disaster recovery.
Regularly test the technology and systems being used.
## Management:

Immediately identify the cause of the technical failure and take steps to address it.
Implement the backup plan for data storage and disaster recovery and store data on Github.
